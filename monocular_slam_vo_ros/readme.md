## Errors:

he package.xml should contain the abstract key g2o. The g2o_rosdep.yaml file is what translates that key into the actual package name that apt-cache search found.
Open your custom YAML file for editing:
nano ~/g2o_rosdep.yaml
Use code with caution.
Bash
Ensure its content is exactly this, using the package name you found:
# Custom rosdep definitions for g2o
g2o:
  ubuntu: [ros-humble-libg2o]
Use code with caution.
Yaml
Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).
Step 2: Correct the package.xml
Open your package.xml:
nano ~/Robotics/monocular_slam_vo_ros/ros2_ws/src/slam_ros2/package.xml
Use code with caution.
Bash
Ensure the dependency section uses the abstract key, not the package name.
<!-- System dependencies needed by the SLAM code -->
  <depend>opencv</depend>
  <depend>eigen</depend>
  <depend>g2o</depend> <!-- This should be the abstract key 'g2o' -->
Use code with caution.
Xml
Step 3: Update the Cache and Run rosdep install
First, update the rosdep cache to make sure it has re-read your corrected YAML file.
rosdep update
Use code with caution.
Bash
Now, run the installation from your workspace root.
cd ~/Robotics/monocular_slam_vo_ros/ros2_ws/
rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y
Use code with caution.
Bash
This sequence will work.



The Solution: Add opencv to Your Custom Definition
We will simply add the opencv key to the same custom rosdep file you created for g2o.
Step 1: Find the Correct OpenCV Package Name
Let's use the same tool you used before to find the ground truth for OpenCV's development package on Ubuntu 22.04 (which Humble uses).
apt-cache search opencv | grep --color=always -E 'dev|libopencv-dev'
Use code with caution.
Bash
You are looking for the main development metapackage. The output should contain libopencv-dev. This is the package that provides the CMake files (OpenCVConfig.cmake) that find_package(OpenCV) needs.
Step 2: Edit Your Custom rosdep Definition File
Now, add the opencv definition to your YAML file.
Open the file for editing:
nano ~/g2o_rosdep.yaml
Use code with caution.
Bash
(You could rename this file to custom_rosdep.yaml to be more generic, but it's not necessary).
Add the opencv entry below the g2o entry. The file should now look like this:
# Custom rosdep definitions
g2o:
  ubuntu: [ros-humble-libg2o]

opencv:
  ubuntu: [libopencv-dev]
Use code with caution.
Yaml
Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).
Step 3: Update and Run rosdep install Again
Update the rosdep cache to re-read your modified YAML file.
rosdep update
Use code with caution.
Bash
Run the installation from your workspace root.
cd ~/Robotics/monocular_slam_vo_ros/ros2_ws/
rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will now resolve g2o, opencv, and eigen correctly. eigen is usually in the default lists, so it shouldn't cause a problem.






# If any error is faced realted to g2o

like   `ls /usr/local/include/g2o/core/block_solver.h` results in not found


Do a clean build

# Create a workspace for building G2O
cd ~
mkdir -p g2o_ws/src && cd g2o_ws/src

# Clone G2O source
git clone https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o.git

# Build and install
cd ..
cmake -S src/g2o -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DG2O_BUILD_APPS=OFF -DG2O_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
sudo cmake --install build


Then check,
`ls /usr/local/include/g2o/core/block_solver.h`
